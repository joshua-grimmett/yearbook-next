  text: `2022 with 5C has been an incredible experience! Together we have explored space, light and the states of matter (Science), solved problems and equations (Math), written engaging texts, both persuasive and narrative (English), overcome our fear to present our MySpeak speeches and worked collaboratively to become Global Innovators (HASS), presenting our ideas to a panel of experts.
  <span class="break"></span>
  We have achieved outside of the classroom too, participating in Debating, Public Speaking, Wakakirri, Strings, Interschool Sports and Sports Days and attending exciting excursions, including the Gold Rush Excursion and Surf Safety. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  Together we have continued to grow and achieve our goals, strengthened our bonds with our classmates, made some amazing friends and hopefully learned some lifelong lessons. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  It has truly been an unforgettable year. I can’t wait to see what we all achieve next year and beyond and wish everyone the best of luck for 2023!
