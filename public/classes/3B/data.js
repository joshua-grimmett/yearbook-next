  <span class="break"></span>
  Some highlights of the year have been collaborating and learning to work together. Students enjoyed constructing 3D shape buildings and cooking our delicious hedgehog slice for measurement. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  Swimming was a fun, action packed week of bus rides and learning new swimming skills. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  Visiting the Ngutana-Lui Cultural Centre was loads of fun where students learnt about traditional medicines, art, and boomerang throwing. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  The Celebration Expo was a well talked about experience shared with families. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  Getting crafty and engaging in hands on science experiments proved to always be a hit with 3B.
  <span class="break"></span>
  It has been an absolute pleasure spending 193 school days watching this beautiful bunch of children grow. We will truly miss you all. Best of luck for year 4.`,
