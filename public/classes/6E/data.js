  text: `Your eyes and ears this way please 6E in 3 *deep inhale* 2 aaannndd 1! 
  As a largely chatty and opinionated group, it comes as no surprise that we’ve had an entertaining year. For every academic lesson there has ALSO been painting, blutack sculpting, tech deck flipping, glue mixing, fantasy fiction fantasising, tissue-paper dying happening too. Rather than viewing these ‘hobbies’ as a distraction, you’ve been celebrated and trusted to be the best version of YOU. Of course, we have students (*cough* and a teacher) who enjoys a quiet environment when learning. Our calming music, silent bursts, couch time, plants and essential oils have been necessary too. Your future will be bright, but in moments when it’s not, I hope my voice is in the back of your head gently reminding you to ‘choose your hard’ asking ‘if not now, then when?’ or bellowing ‘YOU’RE DRIVING 40 ON THE M1!’. I’ve loved being your cheerleader. All the best for 2023 and beyond!`,
