  text: `Prep B certainly started off the year with a ‘bang!’ We didn’t let a little re-shuffle and rain get the better of us though. An amazing amount of perseverance and resilience was displayed by all, and we all kept moving forward with our learning while building life-long friendships and strong relationships.
  <span class="break"></span>
  We have had some wonderful highlights this year that have included Mother’s Day, Under 8’s Day, Father’s Day, Sea World excursion, cross country, and sports fun day. We have had so much fun at all our activities and have certainly been appreciative of all the parent support at our events. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  I have loved having the opportunity to teach every student in Prep B this year and getting to know and work with all the families. They have all grown so much and have each taught me a thing or two. Each student has been successful and developed many strengths I hope they take with them into Year 1. Wishing you all the best!
  <span class="break"></span>
  Thanks for an awesome year!`
