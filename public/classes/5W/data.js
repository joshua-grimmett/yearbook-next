  text: `In 5W we worked as a team, a class that respects, collaborates and learned together every day. We loved the opportunities given to us like going on the excursions, sports days, dressing up and reaching our learning goals. With grit, tenacity, perseverance and resilience we were able to work through challenges and help each other to do the same. We identified and showed accountability of the importance of learning and how we are all lifelong learners. Guiding us through was ... Good at Learning Good at Life.
  <span class="break"></span>
  We have built a city, solved real life problems around bushfires and from our community; identified adaptations around us, made light go around corners, used persuasion in our writing together, travelled to space and back and so much more.
  <span class="break"></span>
  In 5W we have been building skills for our final year in primary school. We have built a solid foundation brick by brick, subject by subject, with these skills our future looks amazing.`,
