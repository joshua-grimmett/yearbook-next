  Mrs Leick is one of the best maths teachers and Mr Nelson can’t be forgotten. Throughout the year, we’ve received awesome 3D-prints, some for education and others for fun. We love it when he tests our teamwork ability with activities requiring strong collaboration.

  While we were at the HASS Trade Show in September, all teachers were walking around, considering the winners. Believe it or not, two groups from our class made it into the top three! That was an unforgettable moment.

  Surf safety was amazing! We played relay races on the sand, while other classes were boogie boarding in the water. Our teamwork skills strengthened as we rescued one another in the waves. We now know what every beach flag means and what to do in an emergency. This will always be a year to remember.
