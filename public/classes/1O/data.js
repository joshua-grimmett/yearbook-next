  text: `10 have had a fantastic year, with Mrs Oxley teaching in the first semester and me – Mrs Frey - in the second. We have had a lot of fun with our hands on learning experiences!
  <span class="break"></span>
  The children’s highlights of the year include their excursion to Jacobs Well Environmental Centre, Sports Fun Day, our Mother’s and Father’s Day celebrations, and making fidget toys in science. They also loved their visit from the local fire department where the children learnt about fire safety, and the ins and outs of a fire engine.
  <span class="break"></span>
  1O danced their hearts out in term 3’s flash mob and looked amazing in the Wakakiri dress up day. I have seen some fantastic art built in the loose parts playground and witnessed some funny scenes from The Three Billy Goats Gruff obstacle course.
  <span class="break"></span>
  I am so proud of the hard work every student has put into their learning this year, and I wish these super stars all the best for year 2! Thank you for a fantastic semester.`
