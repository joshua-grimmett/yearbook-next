  text: `From the moment 4E stepped into our room, we became ‘crewmates’. We established ‘kindness’, ‘learning’ and ‘fun’ as our goals for 2022- and boy have we accomplished them! Collaboratively building Darth Tater each week towards our class ‘Minecraft goals’, celebrating individual successes with emeralds, sapphires and diamonds, and trading for rewards like icy poles, prize box treats, stickers and Tiny Diny hugs!
  <span class="break"></span>
  Together we have explored paper planes and worked through 50s club (and Charles’ Challenge!). We’ve built and played our own cardboard arcade games, and tackled our STEM building challenge, where we build flotation devices, budgeted for materials, and saved poor drowning marbles!!
  <span class="break"></span>
  We took movement breaks hunting Pokémon, racing through the nether and escaping from dinosaurs. Bonus points if you understand Mrs Eckert's Star Wars references! 
  <span class="break"></span>
  Who could forget camp, where we were positive, brave, adventurous, collaborative and very hungry!
  <span class="break"></span>
  Thanks for an amazing year to all my ‘smarties’, 4E!`,
