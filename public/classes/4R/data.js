It has been a pleasure to teach and learn alongside the students of 4R. Every obstacle and change the students faced they have smashed; this alone was displayed in their first school camp! 
  <span class="break"></span>
  In the classroom throughout the year, we have had weekly class meetings in which students were able to refocus their goals and strengthen our class community. Furthermore, we worked together collaboratively, investigated erosion through experiments, got our hands dirty planting cherry tomatoes to explore life cycles, and tuned into our imagination when writing awesome stories. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  There has been some good times and some hard times but together 4R has overcome and have developed a positive mindset. This mindset will see them flourish into year 5 and beyond in their journey to becoming lifelong learners. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  Thank you 4R it has been a blast!
