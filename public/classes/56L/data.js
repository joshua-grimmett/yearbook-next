  text: `The sporty composite class! When asked to describe my class this year I would constantly refer to them as my sporty class because all students had an interest in a particular sport. So much so that when we had sport events – majority of the class were out of action for the day! It kept Miss Landers fit– she even felt obligated to join in with Kokoda (and survived!). I even had to brush up on my handball skills as this class is fierce (and competitive) when it comes to handball, it became our regular wet weather activity. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  When you watch this class at work you would have no idea of the diversity of ages. All students were able to work collaboratively and support each other regardless of what year they were in. Students in 56L used their unique individual skills and interests to create a variety of projects this year. The topics ranged from saving the oceans, custom shoe designs, pet adoption, reef safe sunscreen and so much more! It was inspiring to watch the students become so engaged in their learning and create innovative projects. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  It has been a fun-filled year! Goodluck 56L on all of your future endeavours! Please remember me when you become sport stars!`,
