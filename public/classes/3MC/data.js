  text: `The year 2022 has been remarkable in 3M. Students outdid themselves with their positive attitudes as well as being ‘Good at Learning, Good at Life’.
  <span class="break"></span> 
  Some highlights of the year included our ‘Celebrations’ Expo which was really exciting. We displayed our favourite celebration to teachers, students and parents.  Our Christmas, Easter, Halloween and birthday stands were really festive. Another highlight was learning about Space. We checked out the movement of the sun in the sky and learned that the sun doesn’t actually move, it’s the Earth that spins on its axis. 
  <span class="break"></span> 
  Our excursion to the Ngutana-Lui Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Cultural Studies Centre was lots of fun. Learning how to throw spears and make a boomerang return was harder than it looked. 
  <span class="break"></span> 
  Finally, collaborating together on a daily basis meant strong friendships developed. This helped us to be respectful listeners during our number talks which taught us so much about the relationships of numbers. This made for a very memorable year.`
