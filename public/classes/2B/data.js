  text: `I am so incredibly grateful to have had the twenty-five students that made up the 2B class of 2022.
  <span class="break"></span>
  Thank you to parents for your support throughout the year. Thank you to the 2B students for being such an amazing class. I will miss seeing you you in 2B. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  It’s been a pleasure to watch each student grow and change this year. You have within you, everything you need to continue to be successful. You can move mountains if you want. I wish all of my students, much success in the future.
  <span class="break"></span>
  I know next year is going to be amazing! I hope that you all have a great summer break and that you remember 2022 in Year 2.
  <span class="break"></span>
  Miss Barnes.`
