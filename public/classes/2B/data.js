  text: `I am so incredibly grateful to have had the twenty-five students that made up the 2B class of 2022.
  <span class="break"></span>
  Thanks to everyone, students' parents and carers, for being there and offering your support through the year, you’re the best! I will miss seeing you all in 2B every day? 
  <span class="break"></span>
  It’s been a pleasure to watch each student grow and change this year. You have within you, everything you need to continue to be successful. You can move mountains if you want. I wish all of my students, much success in the future.
  <span class="break"></span>
  I know next year is going to be amazing! I hope that you all have a great Summer break and that you remember 2022 in Year 2.
  <span class="break"></span>
  Miss Barnes.`
