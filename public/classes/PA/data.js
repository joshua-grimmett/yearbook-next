  text: `It has been a wonderful year in Prep A! We’ve had so many great experiences throughout our prep journey together and created some very special friendships along the way. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  We explored under the sea, nursery rhymes and fairy tales. We had some exciting celebrations at school for Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, 100 days of school and Book Week. We participated in the Sports Fun Day, the Easter Hat Parade, swimming lessons and attended our first school excursion to Sea World! We developed our reading and writing abilities, our problem-solving skills and enjoyed working together with classmates each day. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  Miss Atkinson, Mrs Dawson, Mrs S. and Ms Leese feel very fortunate to have met and taught such an incredible group of children. We are so proud of all the gains that the children in Prep A have made in 2022 and look forward to seeing what amazing things everyone will achieve in the future.
