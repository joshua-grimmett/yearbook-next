  text: `3J have had a fantastic year full of new experiences, exciting learning opportunities and fun. They have faced everyday with enthusiasm and worked hard to achieve academic, social and behavioural goals. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  Throughout the year many beautiful friendships were formed. 3J was a classroom where teamwork, acceptance and inclusion were evident every day. Students were always looking out for and helping each other whenever they could.
  <span class="break"></span>
  Cross Country, Sports Fun Day, Swimming, Book Week and our excursion to Ngutana-Lui Centre were some of the exciting events where students got to socialise outside the classroom, be creative and show their talents. Learning about our planet Earth, cooking and conducting some very cool science experiments were some of the highlights inside the classroom. 
  <span class="break"></span> 
  It has been such a pleasure to spend the year with this amazing group of students. I wish them all the best for their Year 4 journey and know that they will continue to achieve wonderful things.  `
