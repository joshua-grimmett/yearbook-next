  text: `Wow! What a year it has been… Starting the school year two weeks later than normal meant that we had to hit the ground running!<br/>
  <span class="break"></span>
  Highlights of Term 1 included weekly science experiments, which helped us to develop scientific inquiry skills and an understanding of how to conduct fair tests. Students demonstrated strength and resilience as we worked through NAPLAN in Term 2, along with the annual ‘MySpeak’ competition. Term 3 included a week of swimming lessons which was thoroughly enjoyed by all, and Term 4 highlights included the excursion to the Ngutana-Lui Cultural Centre and the annual Sports Fun Day.

  Throughout the year in 3M, we have worked hard on building positive relationships and working collaboratively toward common goals. Students helped to develop the classroom currency, Mrs. Marsh’s Magnificent Money Market, and enjoyed purchasing their hard-earned rewards. It was fantastic to see the development of students in 3M over the year, as they worked towards achieving their goals.
