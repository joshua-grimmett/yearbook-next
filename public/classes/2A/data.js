  text: `Wow, what an incredible year 2022 has been! Term 1 was spent getting to know each other, building positive relationships and establishing high expectations. We delved into our learning and became Super Scientists and participated in many fun and exciting experiments. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  This year, we were lucky enough to experience exciting adventures and events that will provide many happy memories for years to come. Some of the highlights include the Cross Country, Swimming Lessons, Disco, Sport Fun Day, Under 8’s Day, excursions to Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary and the Beenleigh Historical Village and Museum, as well as many, many dress up days. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  Special memories have been created in 2022. We have laughed together and worked through many challenges this year. 2A have been an absolute joy to teach and I am so proud of how far they have come. I wish the students all the best for 2023. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  2A – 2Awesome!`
