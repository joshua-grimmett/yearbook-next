  text: `Being in 5EN has truly been an adventure. We have been citizens of the world as we studied it inside (Science units) and out (Space). We have penned great literary works (English), solved problems and deciphered equations (Maths). We have climbed to the tops of mountains (Mystery Doug) and down the deepest of tunnels (City of Ember). We have stretched our minds (our class work) and our muscles (Sports Days). We have been virtuous (MyConnections) and worked virtually (Professor Tech). We have visited the past (Gold Rush) and the future (Global Goals). We have danced (Flash Mob and disco), travelled (excursions) and laughed (a lot).
  <span class="break"></span>
  It has been an extraordinary year of dedication, exciting events and exceptional learning. We have made wonderful friends and strengthened our bonds with old ones as we collaborated on our work and accomplished our goals. We have grown in character (and height!) and can’t wait for Year 6.`,
