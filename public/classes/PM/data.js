  <span class="break"></span>
  The progress in Literacy in Prep M has been outstanding. We have learnt so many new sounds and ‘red words’ that our reading is fantastic. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  Some of our favourite things to do this year have been; colouring in, directed drawings, meeting our Year Six buddies, making craft, going to Sea World, swimming lessons, playing with Lego and the cars. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  Our first year at school has meant that we have learnt lots of new things about sea animals, Nursery Rhymes, Fairy Tales and Gruffalos but one of our favourite things about school is all the dancing we get to do!
  <span class="break"></span>
  Ms Jones, Ms Gemma and Miss Marlow will miss you all very much and we will cherish the memories we have made this year. Good Luck in Year One and we look forward to seeing you around the playground!`
