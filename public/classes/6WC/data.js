  text: `Blessed with the best! – A Recipe You Cannot Detest!
  <span class="break"></span>
  2022 has been the year where 6WC has truly proven that empathy, compassion, teamwork, a love of learning, laughter and determination are the perfect ingredients for the Learning Language recipe.
  <span class="break"></span>
  Starting the year off with the most important utensils of open minds and open hearts meant that 2022 was going to be a true delicacy. Two experienced chefs took charge in this 5-star classroom alongside 50 odd apprentices. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  Solid combinations of curriculum content sprinkled with many Deep Learning experiences, heated hearts and melted mouths. The taste for learning was undeniable. Maths, English, Science and HASS were not only kneaded together but we invited professional chefs from a variety of inspirational delicacies to ignite our passion for navigating this Learning Language recipe. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  Some apprentices found this recipe extremely easy to follow but do you think they served their food early? Not in this kitchen. Instead, we witnessed sleeves rolling up and hands getting dirty to take lead (bypassing the 2 experienced chefs). Extra teaspoons of sugar, loaded with empathy enhancer meant that NOT ONE SINGLE chef was left behind nor one dish served cold.
  <span class="break"></span>
  We opened our doors to many mouth-watering guests who had heard of our 5-star reputation. These guests not only had their minds blown with the flavour amongst our dishes but who also shared their wisdom in so many areas. This taught us one HUGE lesson and that was to never judge a book by its cover – one smile to a stranger can make a world of difference. You truly never know what someone is going through or just how heavy their ‘backpack’ is so JUST BE KIND.
  <span class="break"></span>
  Doesn’t the saying go, “many hands make light work?” 6WC can certainly be proud of proving that this phrase is true. In addition to our sprinkles, kneading, enhancers and teaspoons, we baked this beauty together. All hands were put to work, all smiles were shared together and with one giant warm and cosy oven, we watched our creation rise (6WC).
