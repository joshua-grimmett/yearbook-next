  text: `What an adventurous year we’ve had in 4KP.  
  <span class="break"></span>
  Happy, Fun, Calm, Kind and Respectful were the words students chose to be our GPS words for 4KP in 2022. These words were identified by the students in the first week and have guided our decisions and direction across the year. Together with engaging learning experiences we have encouraged our three teacher goals Connection, Character, and Kindness.  
  <span class="break"></span>
  From the very first day in 4KP when students co-constructed the design of our classroom learning spaces, students have been encouraged to grow as creative, self-regulated, inquisitive life-long learners. It has been exciting and rewarding to see students exceed expectations for these character goals to be Good at learning – Good at life. 4KP has far exceeded our expectations and have developed into a kind, respectful and engaged group of students who are ‘Here for Learning’. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  Character is demonstrated through our actions. We have learnt how to be kind, empathise, and respect ourselves and others. One of our highlights of course was Camp, and together with the many classroom experiences we enjoyed, students were encouraged to continue to learn how to achieve personal and group goals and overcome challenges. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  Connection has been the foundation for all we do, helping us create a positive class culture and a feeling of belonging. Connecting with experts, other schools and organisations, enhanced learning and helped us develop an understanding of different experiences and perspectives.  
  <span class="break"></span>
  Kindness is our name and kindness is our game! The Kindness Crew have grown to be the kindest version of ourselves. A highlight of 2022 was designing solutions for the Sustainable Global Goals and exploring the concept of entrepreneurial thinking. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  We have been privileged to spend the wonderous adventure of 2022 with this amazing group of young people, and to witness their achievements. They are learning how to speak up for themselves, champion others and make a positive impact on the world. 4KP has come so far and we are honoured to have been a part of their journey! `,
