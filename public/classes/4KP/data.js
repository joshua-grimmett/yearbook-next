We have learnt so much in fun and exciting ways like playground hunts, cooking, constructing cities and opening a museum. We were so incredibly proud of all the hard work the children have put in this year.
  <span class="break"></span>
  We loved having our families come in for our HASS celebration day & global goals presentations and we would like to thank the parents who made a special effort to share their cultural celebrations to our class. Learning from people who have lived through it and experienced it is the best kind of lessons and the kids were inspired by you all. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  3WH loved using our exciting behaviour reward system of TeacherMon and we hope that students will keep these exclusive cards for many years to come. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  We have strived to provide challenging and supportive learning experiences for each and every student to help them reach their full potential. Our excursion was epic! 
  <span class="break"></span>
  We loved throwing boomerangs and creating beautiful traditional dot paintings and of course, dancing to the digeridoo. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  3WH had the best time creating our very own one day only museum in our classroom full of adorable creatures and amazing displays. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  We were very excited to improve our swimming skills in term 3. We loved sing alongs on the bus trips and couldn’t wait to test out our speed at the swimming carnival. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  We are so proud of how far you have come this year. 3WH have made new friends and developed our creativity, collaboration and character. We have reached many goals, mastered many skills, learnt many things and of course we have had a lot of fun and laughter along the way. We have absolutely loved being 3WH’s teachers and will miss them greatly next year.`,
