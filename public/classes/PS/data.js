  text: `This year has been the first time in a few years that we have spent all year together at school (give and take a bit of sickness along the way). Looking back to the beginning of the new year when our preppies were shy and nervous, it is always so rewarding to see how far they all have come, both in confidence and independence, but also socially and emotionally.
  <br/>
  <span class="break"></span>
  We asked our students, and they nominated the following as highlights of
  their year:<br> 
  <div class="centerText">• Meeting our new classmates and teachers • The Easter Concert and Easter Bunny visit • Sea World • Sports Days • Mother’s/Fairy Day • Under 8’s Day • Father’s/Pirates Day • Learning about Sea Animals • Maths • Learning • Playing • Book Week • Pyjama Day</span>
  <span class="break"></div>
  We are grateful to have each and every member of Prep S in our
  class this year, and we can’t wait to see you all continue to grow and develop
  over the next few years.`
