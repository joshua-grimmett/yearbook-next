  text: `“I don’t understand this ... yet.”
  <br>“You’ve got this!”
  <br>If you spent time in 5M’s classroom you would often hear the above phrases.  
  <span class="break"></span>
  This is because in 5M we are a team.  We are kind and supportive of one another and understand that mistakes will be made, because no-one is perfect.  We forgive one another and try to understand each other's perspective. We share our ideas and opinions and respectfully give each other feedback, both tickled pink and green for growth.  
  <span class="break"></span>
  In 5M we understand that everyone has different talents and strengths.  We love working together in collaborative groups, talking and learning together.  We ask questions and listen to each other’s answers.
  <span class="break"></span>
  In 5M we value individual growth and goal setting. We understand that with effort and persistence, every student can improve and achieve success.  In 5M we know that maintaining a growth mindset is key, and by remaining positive and listening to our inner coach we can learn and grow from our failures.`,
