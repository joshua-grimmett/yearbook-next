  text: `This year, we have seen so many improvements and achievements with student learning and overall results. We are so proud of the kind and caring students that we have shared the past year with.  
  <span class="break"></span>
  We began 2022 in the most unusual way! Some students enjoyed an extra two-week holiday while others experienced ‘pod life’ at school. Teachers and students were glad to finally be reunited and kick start the school year. Together, we enjoyed learning how to write recounts about personal experiences. Students relished in our weekly experiments when they mixed different liquids to test if they dissolved or not, in our science lessons.  
  <span class="break"></span>
  In Term Two, 2F/S were involved in a week-long swimming experience. Students gained valuable swimming skills while having fun. Later in the term, students enjoyed a morning of ‘Under 8’s Day’ activities such as; pasta necklaces, marble painting, mask making, paper planes and bubbles.
  <span class="break"></span>
  We ended the term by going back in time with an excursion to the Beenleigh Historical Village to consolidate our learning from our history lessons. Seeing real-life olden day houses, shops and a classroom were some highlights of the day.  
  <span class="break"></span>
  In Term Three we learned how to make our writing more interesting with sizzling starts and tightening tensions. During our science lessons, we investigated where we get water from and how to save it.
  <span class="break"></span>
  To conclude the year, we got active at our sports fun day. We loved jumping like kangaroo’s and learning to kick a footy. We dreamed with our eyes open at our annual book week dress up and concluded our learning with a Starbucks themed week where we used our knowledge of money, shape, problem solving, grammar and punctuation, and role-playing to run our own class café.  
  <span class="break"></span>
  Throughout 2022, we have thoroughly enjoyed watching every student flourish, and become confident and show kindness. We wish them all the best for Year Three.`
