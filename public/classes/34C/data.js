  text: `2022 was the most disruptive start to a school year ever!  Not only that, we didn’t start the year as a composite class, but once we settled, we were one!
  <span class="break"></span>
  Introducing bucket filling and complimenting each other on our positive behaviours brought us together in the most kind and respectful way. One of the best outcomes of this practice is our recognising and engaging with others outside of our friendship groups. It was impressive to see these bonds develop. Our classroom was a peaceful environment, and our focus on making learning a priority saw significant personal and academic growth.

  Our year 3’s enjoyed swimming lessons, the Celebration Expo and an excursion to the Ngutana-Lui Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Cultural Studies Centre. Our year 4’s enjoyed camping at Gold Coast Recreation Centre, Tallebudgera...

  So very grateful to have shared it with you all.`,
