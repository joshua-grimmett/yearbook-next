  text: `6WL … What a year it has been! From a late start to the year to flooding and then sickness and ill health keeping many of us at home for extended periods of time, we really did face it all. Although, it was through perseverance we survived these challenges and what can I say, we definitely had a blast.
  <span class="break"></span>
  As the year progressed, your commitment to yourselves through both personal and collaborative growth was astounding to witness. By fully committing to our class values of ‘Respect’, ‘Attitude’ and ‘Effort’, you have all embraced what it means to be members of the 6WL ‘family’. Each of you have shown your abilities to work collaboratively together and use your individual strengths for the betterment of the class. It brings me pride to say that you all entered as primary school students and through your hard work, are now leaving as capable young individuals ready to face what the future has in store for each and every one of you. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  In saying that, I wish you all the best for the future.`,
