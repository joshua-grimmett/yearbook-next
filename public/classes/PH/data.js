  text: `Prep H has had a fantastic year. From the very first day of school this year until now, our students have come a very long way, accomplishing many skills and having many different learning experiences.
  <span class="break"></span>
  Prep H have become friends through learning and play. This year we have had many amazing experiences such as our Sea world experience, Easter concert, Mother's Day, Father's Day, Under 8’s day and Sports fun day 
  <span class="break"></span>
  We learned how to read and write and to make patterns, developed our knowledge of numbers and days of the week. We also learnt about sea animals, nursery rhymes, and Fairy tales.
  <span class="break"></span>
  This year, the first year of formal schooling, is just the start of Prep H’s learning journey. It has been a busy year with many wonderful memories created. Mrs Blanks, Mrs Wilson and Ms Hughes will miss all the amazing children of Prep H and we have really enjoyed working with them every day.`
