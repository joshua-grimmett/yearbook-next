  text: `Well, another year has passed, and the gorgeous class of 2O will start a new adventure into Year 3 very soon. We have thoroughly enjoyed watching the students of 2O grow and fine tune themselves as individuals.
  <span class="break"></span>
  Every student should be proud of their successes this year. We have had many experiences throughout the year that have enhanced our learning, some of these include: an excursion to Beenleigh Historical Village and later to Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary. We celebrated under 8's day, book fair, sports day, and lots more!
  <span class="break"></span>
  While having fun, we've been learning how to read with fluency, write with creativity, communicate, and listen to others, socialise, problem solve, be mathematicians and scientists. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  A big thank you goes out to Mrs Janette Naylor and Mrs Chantel Stone as they have been a huge asset to 20's learning by helping with reading, writing, excursions and swimming, throughout the year.
  <span class="break"></span>
  I encourage you all to be proud of your accomplishments in Year 2, and I know you will all strive to do your very best in Year 3.`
