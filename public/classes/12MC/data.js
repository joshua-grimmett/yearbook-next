  text: `It has been a delight to teach a fantastic group of students in 1/2MC in 2022. There was a two week delay to the start of the school year due to Covid 19 and our composite class was also created after another few weeks of school. Despite the many disruptions, I was very happy to see the students quickly make some great new friendships and collaborate well across both year levels.
  <span class="break"></span>
  The Year Two students led by example to show independence and responsibility when having to manage the requirements within a composite class and the Year One students also adjusted to their new environment with great success. All students have taken on teacher feedback to work on personal behaviour goals to positively change their work ethic within the classroom.
  <span class="break"></span>
  The students in 1/2MC should be proud of the significant academic improvements they have made throughout the year, and I wish them continued success next year.  `
