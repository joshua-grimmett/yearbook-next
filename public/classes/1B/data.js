  A valuable and important point that captures the reason we come to share and learn together in 1B – We are here for learning! And haven’t we been busy doing just that.  It has been a fantastic year and the students have certainly grown in so many ways.  It’s been wonderful to be a part of their learning journey and rewarding to watch their confidence and persistence develop throughout the year. Our classroom has been a place of laughter, smiles, chatter and of course hard work. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  This year has been a busy one filled with exciting events like Jacobs Well Excursion, Easter Hat Parade, ANZAC assembly, Cross Country, Sports Day, free dress days, fun in the Loose parts play areas, Book Week character dress up day and the fire fighters visit. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  I wish my 1B students all the very best for the future as they venture into Year 2.`
