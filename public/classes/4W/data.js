Grade 4 camp was jam packed full of fun, friendships and food! We gained skills in body boarding, archery, high ropes and rock climbing just to name a few. Late night cabin chats, mealtime and games night were moments that brought us closer together.
  <span class="break"></span>
  In the classroom throughout the year, we explored our favourite author, David Williams. We worked together collaboratively, investigated erosion through experiments, got our hands dirty planting cherry tomatoes, captured our imagination through writing stories and became crafty at Christmas time. We celebrated birthdays, set personal goals, shared individual achievements together and developed positive mindsets for lifelong learning. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  It has been an absolute pleasure to be part of 4W! As we progress to year 5, we are well equipped for the adventures that lie ahead!
