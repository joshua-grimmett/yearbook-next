  <span class="break"></span>
  2022 was overflowing with learning and laughter. The dedication, encouragement and enthusiasm of students made each and every day a special one! It has been an absolute privilege to witness students blossom this year. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  We were engrossed in the adventures of ‘Lina and Doon’ in the City of Ember. Inspired by our shared reading we produced outstanding narrative, persuasive and informative texts. The creativity kept flowing through into our spectacular magazine articles. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  With countless extra-curricular activities available in 2022, 5B students displayed amazing dedication, especially on the sporting field. Kid Fit was certainly a highlight every Friday morning for all the students – not to be missed! 
  <span class="break"></span>
  There were tears, laughter and extraordinary stories to be heard in their mySpeak speeches. I was most impressed with the support they gave each other after their presentations. Wakkakirri was a huge highlight for a number of our 5B students, the class was very supportive and enjoyed watching the performance at school. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  In Term 4, students enjoyed travelling back in time to experience life on the gold fields. The panning and cradling for gold along the river was so much FUN! The memories will last a lifetime. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  I would like to thank all the 5B children and parents for an amazing year. Each and every one of the students have matured, succeeded and shone in their own way. I wish them all the very best for their future and Year 6.`,
