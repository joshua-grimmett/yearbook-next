  It has been another deadly year for our Bullang Jarjumms Team! A major highlight was the introduction of a new student leadership position, our Jarjumms Leader, who in 2022 was Imogen Hay.

  Our amazing school artwork, painted by Rhianne and Rachel Williams, is now on display and can be found in many physical and digital spaces within the school. The elements of the artwork represent the Coomera River and the different community groups which are connected to and come together through the school.

  The Indigenous Use Garden in our Yarning Circle Precinct is flourishing. A native beehive has been an interesting addition, with these bees being rehomed to Coomera Rivers after being rescued from a land clearing site by a qualified beekeeper. The bees are now well established in their home and thriving. We have also recently added signage to the garden, identifying each plant, their uses, and name in traditional language (either Yugambeh or Bundjulung).

  Across the school, we continue to commemorate and celebrate significant dates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, including Sorry Day and Reconciliation Week, NAIDOC Week, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Childrenâ€™s Day and Indigenous Literacy Day, and our jarjumms have continued to be involved in the Deadly Choices and Solid Pathways programs this year. In addition to these events and programs, we are proud of the work we do to embed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures, histories and perspectives within the curriculum, as well as connecting with families and community.
