A special thank you to all our families, students, staff and volunteers who have again supported our P&C team, allowing us to organise numerous fun filled events.

  A year that starts with Tissues & Tim Tams for our Prep families through to a welcoming picnic for new families for 2023 and everything in between.  A Hollywood Disco was a great way for students to dress up as their favourite celebrities, and of course you can’t beat a Spooky Disco for Halloween.  A Cookie Dough Drive to encourage some school holiday baking, and a very colourful event that always leaves its mark.  We had special NAPLAN celebration boxes, Subway Sports Day lunches, and let’s not forget about two very special days – Mother’s Day and Father’s Day where our students surprised their parents and grandparents with very useful and cute gifts from our online stalls. We’ve had Preppies personally design mementos, and Year 6’s putting their special touch on their Signature Bears.  And, what about our staff shirts, our Year 6 senior shirts and our new sports uniforms for all sports codes. Don’t they look awesome!

  Who can miss the new additions to the school that the P&C have also been involved with – electronic gates at both ends of the school grounds, new spunky laminates on the toilet doors and landscaping to uplift the OSHC area.  We were also fortunate enough to receive grants in 2022 from Councillor Cameron Caldwell, Donna Gates and Stuart Robert involving Community Support, Loose Parts, Volunteers and Recycling.

  Again, without the amazing support we receive, our P&C team could achieve the things they have this year.  Thank you to all.  `,
