  text: `Having to hold an audience and speak freely sends most people running.  However, at Coomera Rivers, we have many courageous students who not only embrace the opportunity to develop and perfect these skills but they excel at it.   
  <span class="break"></span>
  The A B Paterson Public Speaking Competition sees thousands of students from across the Gold Coast, from both the private and public sector, enter the Public Speaking arena.  While the Year 4 students are not officially entering a ‘competition’, they still gain valuable experience and confidence.
  <span class="break"></span>
  Interestingly, public speaking at Coomera Rivers is usually dominated by the girls, however Year 4 broke that tradition and we saw our team consist of 7 boys and just 1 girl. Our young competitors, although nervous, were all buzzing after their speeches and have vowed to return next year.  They’ve caught the performance adrenaline bug!
  <span class="break"></span>
  For Year 5 and 6, the competition only allowed schools to enter 5 students per year level which lifted the calibre of speakers across the entire competition.  All students spoke incredibly well and their speeches were both entertaining and informative 
  <span class="break"></span>
  Special mention must go to Connor and Micaela who successfully made it through to the preliminary finals and needed to return to do their speech the following week at A B Paterson College. While Micaela’s speech ‘For the longest time’ urged people not to dismiss the idea of pineapple on pizza, it was Connor’s speech on ‘Life is beautiful’ that earned him a position in the grand final.  Although he didn't place in the grand final, it's important to note he is now ranked in the top 8 speakers.  What an outstanding achievement. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  Congratulations to all our students for being selected to represent our school.  They certainly captivated their audience and made us all very proud.
