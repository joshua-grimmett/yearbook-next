  At Coomera Rivers, we pride ourselves with the opportunities we provide our students when it comes to sport. In 2022, we had teams represent our school in Touch, AFL, Rugby League, Basketball, Netball and Table Tennis.
  <span class="brick"><h2>Touch</h2>
  Coomera Rivers has had a busy year when it comes to Touch. We had teams represent us at Interschool Sport, Coomera Cup, Kings Christian College Touch Tournament, Primary All Schools Touch weekend and we sent along our Junior Development girls to the Keebra Park Girls’ Sport Academy Touch day. It is amazing to see how much our students develop their skills over the course of the year.

  <span class="brick"><h2>AFL</h2>
  Coomera Rivers entered a Primary Male and Primary Female team into the AFLQ Schools Cup. Both teams did a tremendous job when competing and our girls team went undefeated and progressed to the Regional Finals. The competition started with roughly 200 schools and making the Regional Finals meant that our girls’ team were in the top 15 of the competition.
  </span>
  <span class="brick"><h2>Rugby League</h2>
  Our Rugby League teams coached by Mr Bradley & Mr Taylor had plenty of playing opportunities, competing in the NRL Gala Day, Broadwater Cup, Coomera Cup and Interschool Sport. All students exhibited great character, played hard and fair, and were respectful on and off the field. 
  </span>
  <span class="brick"><h2>Basketball</h2>
  Our Year 5/6 basketball team coached by Mr Lewis did a remarkable job competing against Coomera Springs. We managed to get the victory and retain the Coomera Cup. 
  </span>
  <span class="brick"><h2>Table Tennis</h2>
  Congratulations to the students who won our Coomera Rivers Table Tennis Tournament. They went on to represent our school at the Gold Coast Schools Table Tennis competition. The best table tennis players on the coast compete for a podium finish.
