  <span class="break"></span>
  Students at Coomera Rivers who excel in a certain sport are invited to trial for representative sport teams with the goal of being selected in a Queensland School Sport team. To make a Queensland team, first students will be selected in the Broadwater District side, then the South Coast Regional team and then finally, the Queensland team. It is very difficult to be selected in any of these representative teams, so it is amazing to see how many gifted and talented students we have at Coomera Rivers. Congratulations to the following students on their achievements.

  <h1>Kokoda 2022</h1>
  <span class="break"></span>
  This year, our Coomera Rivers Crusaders participated in the Kokoda Challenge 18km Schools Cup, to help raise money for the Kokoda Youth Foundation. Central to the KYF is the Spirit of Kokoda, embodying courage, endurance, mateship and sacrifice. In Term 1, we started our training for the Kokoda Challenge â€“ the focus was to build in our students these core values of the Kokoda Youth Foundation. Our amazing teams sacrificed their Saturday mornings each fortnight to improve their physical toughness, but more importantly, their mental toughness. We were very proud of our 5 teams and how much they progressed over the course of the 5 months. A huge congratulations to Coomera Rivers Crusaders 1 (Remmy, Leyla, Roxy, Mylah and Mr Burrows) who were the first primary school to cross the line in the event! Thank you so much to all of our students, families, coaches and support staff who helped make the experience so amazing to be a part of.`,
