  <h1>Interschool Sport</h1>
  In 2022, Coomera Rivers students in Year 5 and 6 had the opportunity to participate in the Norther Cluster Interschool Sport program. Across 2 Terms of the school year, we entered teams in Rugby League, Netball, Touch, Soccer, and Oz Tag. We were fortunate enough to win the inaugural shield in Touch Football and Netball but more importantly, all the students that chose to represent our school did so with pride and perfectly followed our school sport ethos of Fun, Fitness and Friendship.

  <h1>Sports Fun Days</h1>
  The weather postponed our Sports Fun Days, but we were able to hold our 3-day carnival in Week 1 of Term 4. It was amazing to see all students, teachers and parents supporting their house by wearing their sports house colours and cheering for their mates. Fun, Friendship and Fitness is the focus for our carnivals, and that is evident in all the cheering from our students and smiles on their faces. We began the days with our lap and sprint races, which always draws some huge cheers. We spent the middle section of the day participating in heaps of exciting activities, trying to score points for our houses. Pedley were victorious overall with a 3-peat, winning in 2020, 2021 and 2022!

  <h1>Health & Physical Education</h1>
  <span class="break"></span>
  2022 was an amazing year for the Health and Physical Education department. We view HPE as an opportunity to provide our students with positive life skills and teach the importance of being active and healthy. This year we witnessed a lot of growth in the students’ sporting development, and we enjoyed the enthusiasm that every student brought to lessons.
