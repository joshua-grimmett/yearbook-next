In the beginning, you would have to drag me by my feet to go first for MySpeak. That same kid becoming a school leader? That’s what I thought, but here I am. With the support of all of my teachers and family, I found myself here, in this position and I’m happy to say, I am so grateful. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  While in this position, I’ve experienced so many wonderful memories I will cherish forever. The opportunities, the friends by my side, the events, the most fun I have had in all of my life. If you were to ask me what moment at Coomera Rivers that I am the most proud of, I would wholeheartedly say the moment Mrs Artz announced my name at the Year 5 end of year awards. My friends say the moment my face lit up was priceless. The second the photos were concluded, I burst into tears of happiness. Becoming Head of Student Council was an achievement I will never forget and one that will aid my leadership roles in the future.

  In every class from grades 3 to 5, two students are elected to be the Student Council and Deputy based on their campaign speech presented to their peers; majority vote from the kids deciding the duo. Along with representing their class, a junior buddy class is paired to them. The Student Councillor’s job is to then relay any questions, ideas or suggestions from both their buddy and regular class to improve the school, to me at our meetings. These Student Councillor meetings are held on Wednesdays and are hosted by yours truly, Mrs Artz and my fellow student leaders, Annabelle and Lucas. We have spoken about our chosen charity; this year’s being Team Seas, run by Mr Beast, along with free dress days and the list goes on. The biggest decision I contributed to was definitely our 2022 Senior shirts. This is Coomera Rivers’ first year of shirts dedicated to grade 6. The Year 6 student councillors, Annabelle, Lucas and I were involved in the design of the shirt and then voted on the final product. We are so very proud of them.

  I’d like to thank all teachers, P&C, and staff alike for making Coomera Rivers great. I would like to make some special mentions to the people who stood out to me. Firstly, Miss Ellison, my Grade 6 teacher. Her and I have a close bond that I never really had with any other teacher. And finally, Mrs Artz, no matter what extracurricular I joined, she always seemed to be there. From Wakakirri, to netball, to debating. Sometimes I wonder if she’s stalking me!
  <span class="break"></span>
  Lastly, to the student who takes my place. Remember, you can’t take all the responsibility on your own, you have others around you who are there to help and support you. That’s true teamwork.`,
