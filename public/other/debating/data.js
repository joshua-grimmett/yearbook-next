  text: [`If we want our students to be 'Good at Learning, Good at Life', then we need them to be able to think critically and consider all viewpoints.  This is why we consider debating to be such a valuable skill at Coomera Rivers. Not only do students expand on their public speaking skills, they take them one step further by learning to listen to opposing views, gather evidence to support a viewpoint and respond accordingly.

  <h1>The Great Debate</h1>
  <span class="break"></span>
  We started our year with our traditional ‘Great Debate’ which is now in its 8th year. This is a competition that sees students from Year 6 compete against Pimpama State Secondary College's Year 7 students. The aim of the debate is to prove that it doesn't matter how old you are, if your arguments are strong and well supported with credible evidence, if you deliver your arguments with a passionate confidence, you can persuade any audience. Your voice matters!
  <span class="break"></span>
  The topic up for debate this year was ‘That the school years are the best years of our lives,’ with our team arguing the affirmative side. Representing Coomera Rivers was

  1st speaker: Ashley M
  <br/>2nd speaker: Annabelle F
  <br/>3rd speaker: Annabelle N
  <br/>Silent Speaker: Ella G.  
  <br/>Chairperson: Poppy G

  <span class="break"></span>
  Our students were phenomenal in their delivery and created an excellent exemplar debate for our neighbouring schools. Our team came away from the debate victorious proving that the school years are the best years of our lives because you always have someone around to carry your backpack.  And it’s not because you have a bad back!

  `,`<h1>Coomera Alliance Debating Competition</h1>
  <span class="break"></span>
  This is the 4th year that Coomera Rivers has organised and hosted our very own Coomera Alliance Debating competition.  A competition designed to bring our local schools together to learn the valuable skill of presenting and defending a side of an argument in a friendly competition.  This year saw 8 schools involved in the competition. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  This competition runs throughout Term 4, so while we don’t currently have an overall winning school, at the time of writing this Year Book, we have 6 teams from Year 4 to 6 who are keeping up with tradition and are currently undefeated. We will need to wait and see which schools fight it out in the Grand Final in Week 9.
  <span class="break"></span>
  A very big thank you to all staff who have fostered a love of public speaking and debating in our students and to our staff who have given up their evenings and afternoons to support the competition.  Our students certainly have a formidable reputation in this field!`],
