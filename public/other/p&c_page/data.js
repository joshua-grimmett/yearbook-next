  <span class="break"></span>
  The start of the school year was a little different to normal as COVID, once again disrupted our plans, but, as the year progressed and the restrictions lessened, we finally had our community back onsite and back into the swing of things.
  <span class="break"></span>
  And what a difference that makes to a school community.
  <span class="break"></span>
  With restrictions easing we were able to welcome back volunteers within the community assisting in classrooms, excursions, the café and school events. Whilst we have always known the positive impact our volunteer team has on student learning, engagement and opportunities, after a year without the ability to access this support, it was with great excitement that we could return to having the volunteer teams assistance. I sincerely thank every volunteer for their contribution to our school community.
  <span class="break"></span>
  Another highlight of the year was being able to welcome back our families to school events onsite. It is well documented that good parent-school partnerships are one of the best ways to support children’s learning, development and wellbeing and, whilst during the COVID restrictions of 2021, our staff and families found new and innovative ways to connect, there is no substitution for direct contact and in person involvement. So, with that in mind, our staff and students were very excited to be able to welcome our families back into classrooms to celebrate learning, share in our excursions, celebrate special holidays and cheer us on at our Sports Days. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  Recognising the many and varied impacts that 2021 had on families, the P&C invested in the emotional support for our entire community and engaged Dr Justin Coulson to share his expertise with us. Dr Coulson conducted student, staff and family sessions and provided our families with free premium access to his Happy Families website. We see our partnership with Dr Coulson as an invaluable resource for our entire school community and we look forward to working with Dr Coulson and his team again in 2023.
  <span class="break"></span>
  It never ceases to amaze me how much our school community can achieve and this is in no small part due to our staff team.
  <span class="break"></span>
  Our staff team is a dynamic group of dedicated professionals. From the facilities team to classroom teachers, office staff to assistant teachers, our OSHC team to specialist teachers, our wellbeing team to our school Executive team - every single person in every team is committed to meeting and exceeding expectations with the common goal of providing the best outcomes for our students and families. I would like to thank our staff team for another exceptional year.
  <span class="break"></span>
  `,`Thank you must also go to our families. Your support in working with our teachers to achieve the best social, emotional and academic outcomes for your children is very much appreciated. Your commitment to support and contribute to our fundraising efforts is something we are also very grateful for. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the P&C Executive team of Bridgette Raschke, Gemma Del Re and Heather Mulders. This team volunteer countless hours in providing support to our school community. It is their commitment and service to school that ensures that we can offer our families a range of supports, events and opportunities. On behalf of our school and community, I thank each of them for their outstanding service.
  <span class="break"></span>
  As the 2022 school year draws to a close, I hope the Year Book helps you reflect on the amazing events and achievements from throughout the year and that you join us in looking forward to another successful year in 2023.
