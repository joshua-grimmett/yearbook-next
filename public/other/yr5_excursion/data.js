  Year 5 attended two great excursions this year. The Surf Safety program at Burleigh Heads and we stepped back in time to 1854, the time of the Australian Gold Rush. Surf Life Saving Queensland educates more than 500,000 people about surf safety every year. This frontline approach to safety allows the public and students to make informed, and potentially lifesaving, decisions before even stepping onto a beach. What a great day!

  Our final excursion was set in thick bushland where students experienced what life was like in a gold field township. Businesses were active, licences were bought, and gold was sought and exchanged. Students were off digging for alluvial gold, building tents, baking damper and haggling for goods. The bakers were busy kneading the dough for a delicious taste of damper and syrup. The day ended with everyone searching for gold ‘Eureka’! Then taking their findings back to town to haggle with the Assayers and Claims Officers. Great teamwork and perseverance were shown throughout the many activities in both excursions including sand races, saving your buddy, tent building and gold panning. Experiences that we will not forget.  </span>`,
