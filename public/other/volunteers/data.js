  We have a fresh new team heading our café this year and a wonderful team of volunteers supporting them. You can always guarantee a good laugh, coffee, and a chat whilst preparing the nutritional healthy meals our kids get to enjoy. Our Café team have had to overcome some crazy hurdles this year. Who can forget the grocery supply issues we encountered and the insane pricing of lettuce at $12 a head. The Café team does a tremendous job and our kids’ bellies are more appreciative of the deliciousness.

  Our volunteers are always excited to attend our many excursions through the various school levels. They attended SeaWorld, Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary, Jacobs Well Environmental Centre, and Ngutana-Lui Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Cultural Centre. It is always a fabulous day and the smiles on the kids' faces say it all, particularly when they get to share this experience with you.

  To each of our amazing and selfless volunteers, we thank you for the time and generosity that you give to the school community.  You are very much appreciated.`,
