    `We are so happy that we got chosen as the Foxwell Heads of House because we love to show our passion and pride for our mighty house. We think we were chosen because we stood out amongst our peers as people who show good leadership skills. We are confident, respectful and fun to be around. We enjoyed being Heads of house because we got to interact with the younger students, and hopefully we showed them what it looks like to be a leader. Ella - “My best memory was Sport Fun Days and being involved with the junior school during their tabloid activities”. Rocca - “My favourite part was cheering all the runners over the finish line”. We had so much fun being Heads of House and feel privileged to lead the mighty Foxwell in 2022.`
    ,`This year, we were given the privilege of being House Leaders for Colman. We were so happy that we were selected as leaders as we know how many Year 6 students wanted to be in our position. It was an absolute honour to wear the red with pride. We believe we were chosen as we are two of the biggest cheerleaders in the school, we have passion in our war cries and believe we are good role models for the younger students of Coomera Rivers.  We enjoyed being Colman Heads of House because we got the opportunity to show what fun, friendship and fitness looks like. One of our favourite memories was shouting our war cry so hard that we lost our voices – it was all worth it to see our house cheering as hard as us. We can move on to high school knowing that we did our best to represent the mighty, mighty Colman.`
    ,`I was happy to be the leader of Pedley as I was able to hype up the house at all sporting carnivals while also leading the war cries. It was fantastic to help all the younger year levels with their activities and spread house spirit throughout Pedley. I believe I was chosen to be a house leader as I am kind and compassionate while also being a leader. On Year 6 camp, we learnt all about leading from behind and not having to be the biggest voice in the room to be a leader and I believe this encompasses my leadership style. I enjoy supporting the younger students and encouraging them to be their best. My best memory of being a house leader was getting to raise the house trophy upon Pedley’s win of the 2022 Sports Fun Days. I have enjoyed every moment and responsibility of being a house leader and I thank my peers and teachers for selecting me for this role in 2022.`
    ,`We are so proud to have been House Captains for Siganto in 2022. There were so many awesome opportunities that were presented to us, and we enjoyed every moment of them. We believe we were chosen to lead Siganto this year because we show great leadership skills, we love sport, and we love being role models for the students in the junior school. One of our highlights was leading our Sports Fun Days. We got to lead many war cries, assist the Prep and Year 1 students with the races and activities and we got to cheer on the other houses. Being Heads of House is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and we are very grateful that we could be a part of it. It was definitely one of the highlights of Year 6. GO SIGANTO!`
