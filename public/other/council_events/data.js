It is their role to take ideas from not only their own class but their junior buddy class and bring them to our student council meetings.  Given the number of extra-curricular activities that run during lunch breaks and the number of wet weather lunches we experienced this year, meetings were limited but when we did have them, our team of representatives were full of ideas and enthusiasm to fulfil their role. 
  <span class="break"></span>
  Our very first meetings are dedicated to establishing our ‘chosen charity’ for the year.  It was a very hard decision and it was very clear that our students are very passionate about caring for our environment, particularly the plastic problem.  This year our student councilors chose to support the international fundraiser, “Team Seas”.  All money raised by the group goes towards ocean conservation and clean-up.  The fundraiser pledges to remove one pound of plastic for every dollar raised.   What great environmental ambassadors we have!

  Our student councilors have also managed to financially support our 2022 Kokoda Teams.  For our school to enter teams into this event, there is also a minimum fundraising component that each team must meet.  So this is where the student council stepped in, not only to support our own students but also the Kokoda Youth Foundation – an Australian charity that aims to change local kids’ lives through outdoor experiences, mentorship and ‘The Spirit of Kokoda.’

  Free dress days organized by our wonderful student council include, wear orange for Bullying! No Way Day, Wear Wacky for Wakakirri, Tu-Tu Tuesday and the wear red for Day for Daniel.`,
